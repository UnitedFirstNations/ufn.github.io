#### **How we choose to govern ourselves matters. Let's build a democracy that works.**

"Why not just ask for a constitutional convention?":

The [US Declaration of Independence](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript) was signed 1776. This year will mark the 247th year since its signing. I believe that for the changes needed in our global governmental systems, laws passed by corrupt politicans will not cut it. Thus, I ask you: what will this continent look like 247 years from today? What will this hemisphere look like in the year 2270? Did we solve the climate emergency? Was Earth still habitable? 

## "Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!" -Patrick Henry
