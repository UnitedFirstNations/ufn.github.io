A  few questions to consider prior to reading:
The US Declaration of Independence was signed 1776. This year will mark the 247th year since its signing. Thus, what will this continent look like 247 years from today? What will this hemisphere look like in the year 2270? With the ongoing climate emergency, will Earth still be habitable?

Please read the original document. 
Consider: Who was the audience?

"We, the people of the United First Nations, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Declaration of Independence for the United First Nations.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

We solemnly declare that we have suffered long enough under the tyranny of a corrupt and oppressive regime that has violated our rights, plundered our resources, and endangered our lives. We have appealed to its justice and magnanimity in vain. We have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms, only to be met with repeated injury. We have remonstrated against its usurpations and invasions, only to be met with force and violence. We have endeavored to live in peace and harmony with our neighbors, only to be met with hostility and aggression.

We therefore declare that we are, and of right ought to be, a free and independent nation. We dissolve all political connection between us and the United States of America. We assert our right to establish our own government, to make our own laws, to levy our own taxes, to regulate our own commerce, to defend our own borders, to make our own alliances, and to do all other acts and things which independent nations may of right do.

We pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. We appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions. We invoke the protection of Divine Providence for our cause. And we mutually agree to support this Declaration with a firm reliance on the power of truth and justice."

We declare that the government of the United States of America has become such a destructive force, that it has violated our rights, oppressed our people, exploited our resources, corrupted our institutions, and endangered our planet. We declare that we are no longer subject to its authority, nor bound by its laws. We declare that we are a free and independent nation, with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and do all other acts and things which independent nations may of right do.

We pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. We pledge to respect the diversity of our cultures, languages, religions, and identities. We pledge to protect the environment and promote renewable energy sources. We pledge to cooperate with other nations and peoples in the spirit of peace and solidarity. We pledge to uphold the values of democracy, human rights, social justice, and mutual aid.

We appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions. We appeal to the opinions of humankind for the justice of our cause. We appeal to the future generations for the sustainability of our vision.

We hereby declare ourselves as the United First Nations."

"We, the representatives of the United First Nations, in General Congress assembled, solemnly declare and publish to the world our reasons for dissolving the political bands which have connected us with the United States of America, and for assuming among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle us.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among People, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

The history of the present Government of the United States of America is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these Nations. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

[Here insert a list of grievances against the U.S. government]

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Government whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our American brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the United First Nations of America, in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Nations solemnly publish and declare,

That these United Nations are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the United States of America; that all political connection between them and that Government is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace contract Alliances establish Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

And for the support of this Declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred Honor."

**v4** 

"To all people of the world,

We, the representatives of the United First Nations, in general congress assembled, solemnly publish and declare that these nations are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the former United States of America, and that all political connection between them and the said states is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

We have patiently suffered a long train of abuses and usurpations by the former United States of America, which have reduced us under absolute despotism. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations. But they have been deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation.

We pledge our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor to this declaration of independence. We appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions. And we mutually pledge to each other our support and cooperation in this great cause.

Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the nations present on this second day of May in the year two thousand twenty-three.

Signed,

The Representatives of the United First Nations"

# My Approach to the Constitution

 - Term limits on all members to one year. We vote via consensus. 
 - The 1st or 2nd amendment must include a right to well-being. This includes a right to healthcare and information. If you own a gun, prove you know how to use it. The sharpest shooters get to keep their weapons. The worse you are, the more the government will pay you to sell your weapon to the better shooters who will be our militia.
 - Policing can be done by an app. 
 - Every citizen has complete control over every system in their own body. And every citizen's input is valued.
 - The governing system of this country shall be sociocracy. This includes on political, economic, and social matters. 
 - The central bank of the country will provide for the needs of all citizens. 
 - Every citizen gets equal access to a UBI, healthcare, education, housing, clothing, information, technology, and a job that builds a sustainable future for themselves.
