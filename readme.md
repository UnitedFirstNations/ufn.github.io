### [UFN Founding Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UyIVXY5gRCpqHhSNSJuv1oSqAMLoJkzz55F362igWHw/edit?usp=sharing)

A few questions to consider prior to reading:

The US Declaration of Independence was signed 1776. This year will mark the 247th year since its signing. Thus, what will this continent look like 247 years from today? What will this hemisphere look like in the year 2270? With the ongoing climate emergency, will Earth still be habitable?

Please read the original document.

Consider: Who was the audience?
