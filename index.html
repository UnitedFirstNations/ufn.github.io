    <p>Attempt 2: write the declaration of independence of the United First Nations (a fictional country that rises up in what's left of the USA) This is for a solarpunk utoptian novel.</p>
    <hr></hr>
    <p>We, the people of the United First Nations, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Declaration of Independence for the United First Nations.</p>
    <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all people are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among people, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.</p>
    <p>We solemnly declare that we have suffered long enough under the tyranny of a corrupt and oppressive regime that has violated our rights, plundered our resources, and endangered our lives. We have appealed to its justice and magnanimity in vain. We have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms, only to be met with repeated injury. We have remonstrated against its usurpations and invasions, only to be met with force and violence. We have endeavored to live in peace and harmony with our neighbors, only to be met with hostility and aggression.</p>
    <p>We therefore declare that we are, and of right ought to be, a free and independent nation. We dissolve all political connection between us and the United States of America. We assert our right to establish our own government, to make our own laws, to levy our own taxes, to regulate our own commerce, to defend our own borders, to make our own alliances, and to do all other acts and things which independent nations may of right do.</p>
    <p>We pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. We appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions. We invoke the protection of Divine Providence for our cause. And we mutually agree to support this Declaration with a firm reliance on the power of truth and justice.</p>
