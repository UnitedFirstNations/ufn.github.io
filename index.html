They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p><p>We, therefore, the Representatives of the United First Nations of America, in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Nations solemnly publish and declare,</p><p>That these United Nations are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the United States of America; that all political connection between them and that Government is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace contract Alliances establish Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.</p><p>And for the support of this Declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p></blockquote>";
